# Toronto Shelter System Flow

This repository is concerned with the flow of population within Toronto's shelters. This publicly available data set contains detailed information about individuals who are entering and leaving each city-sponsored shelter. Via storing this information in a public database, specific qualities such as first-time shelter users and individuals who move to homes can be easily recorded and shared. We consider this data, and analyze the impacts on the shelter system through the years 2020-21.
